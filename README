Minor modifications to Tony Buser's Thingiview.js
(https://github.com/tbuser/thingiview.js)
to allow dynamic 3D display of STL file in WISEngineering and WISE4.

This is a step-type, so the entire directory drops into:
$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/vlewrapper/vle/node/
and, with some minor modifications to 
$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/vlewrapper/vle/node/setupNodes.js
to include this path, the new step type will work.
(there are still a few bugs to work out...)
