USE CASE 1:

student uploads STL file

 --> STL file translated to JSON on client
 --> STL-JSON persists as state data for step (in database)
 --> STL file sent in entirety to server, studentuploads (using student uploader)

step renders STL file


========================
USE CASE 2:

student visits step that formerly had an STL file uploaded

step renders STL file (from JSON in database)
